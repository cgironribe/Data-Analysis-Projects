Data Analysis Project: Movies Database
Overview
  
This project aims to create a functional database structure to store information about various movies. The database was built using SQL Server Management Studio (SMSS), 
with data collected from authentic sources such as Google and supplemented with dummy data generated from Mockaroo.com. 
The primary objective was to establish a comprehensive database capable of storing details about movies, directors, cast members, and related information.

Features
  
Utilized SMSS to create and manage the database structure.
Gathered authentic information from Google to populate the database.
Generated dummy data using Mockaroo.com and prepared it in Excel before inserting it into the SMSS database.
Created tables to store information about movies, directors, cast members, etc.
Developed a visualization using Power BI based on queries executed in SMSS.
The Power BI visualization provides insights into customer preferences during the initial weeks of the project.
  
Database Structure

The database comprises several tables to organize and store movie-related information:
Movies: Contains details about each movie, including title, year of release, rating, synopsis, and duration.
Directors: Stores information about movie directors, including their first name, last name, birthdate, and country.
Actors: Stores information about the cast members of each movie, including their first name, last name, birthdate, and country.
Genres: Contains different movie genres.
Languages: Stores information about languages in which movies are available.
Customers: Includes data about customers who interact with the movie database, such as their personal information, membership status, and contact details.
Memberships: Defines different membership tiers and their privileges.
Ratings: Stores ratings and comments provided by customers for movies.
Stock Movies: Keeps track of available units of each movie in stock.
Status: Defines various statuses for rented movies, such as pending, rented, returned, and late.
Rented Movies: Records transactions of rented movies by customers, including the status, movie ID, customer ID, and rental date.
  
The Power BI visualization offers interactive insights into customer preferences, allowing users to explore trends and patterns in movie choices during the early stages of the project.
