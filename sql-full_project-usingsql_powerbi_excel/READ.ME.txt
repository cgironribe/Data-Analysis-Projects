Welcome!

For this project I've decided to build my own database to extract fictitious data and aid in creating meaningful visualizations using PowerBI and Excel tools. I've utilized Quickdb to craft diagrams depicting tables and their relationships and relied on SQL Server for the database's creation and relationships definition. Various Triggers and Stored Procedures have been created to streamline data management, and each file contains a brief description for ease of understanding. I've utilized the 'Mockaroo' website to generate fictitious data in Excel, (some of it intentionally corrupted) and subsequently data cleansing using Excel formulas. Excel was then used to import this cleaned data into SQL for further analysis and to perform the necessary queries to convert them into visualizations. Each file distinctly outlines each of the actions I've just described, making it easier for visualization.
